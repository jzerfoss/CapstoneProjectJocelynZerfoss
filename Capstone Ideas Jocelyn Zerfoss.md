1. My first choice for my capstone idea is a travel planner app. I would like the app to act as a travel assistant with an itinerary generator that would be based on a userâ€™s budget that would suggest flights and hotels to fit their needs. The app could include weather forecast information and potentially a language translation aspect. The app would allow users to send their travel plans to others and allow for collaboration.  
2. Second option for my capstone idea is a real estate price prediction app. This app would use past pricing data and predict real estate prices and provide investment advice for users. It would take property details like location, size, and type and generate estimated value and potential for future changes.  
3. The third choice would be a cryptocurrency portfolio tracker app. The app would track performance of many cryptocurrencies by using real time data and historical data that would personalize recommendations on how to improve their portfolio.
